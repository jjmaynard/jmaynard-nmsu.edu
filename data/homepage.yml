  content : "Yoga Garden classes are in-person classes held in a beautiful room in a church in NW Corvallis. Children's classes are held weekly in 7-8 week sessions each quarter. During this  unusual time, Yoga Garden will be working to provide various types of yoga or mindfulness classes in video format. These video classes are very different from the format of a regular Yoga Garden class. Our in-person classes are very interactive, with group games, stories, and sharing as well as yoga poses and meditations. The videos are my best current effort to help my students keep up a practice and explore yoga in a different setting. My great hope is that we can all be together again and practicing yoga with joy, security, and celebration!"
